### What I Learned

Pretty simple overall but I was having difficulty getting the img in the spot I wanted. It kept wanting to overflow its container. The only solution I found was setting the img {width: 97%}. Why that number? I'm not sure when i set the width to 100% the image becomes offset. If you know why this is could you please let me know?
